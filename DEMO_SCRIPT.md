What if finding the perfect study partner was as easy as swiping right? Meet StudyBuddy.

Every semester, students struggle alone. Traditional tutoring is expensive, and finding compatible study partners feels impossible. StudyBuddy changes everything.

Watch as Sarah logs into her dashboard. She sees her enrolled courses: Calculus, Data Structures, and Physics. Her active study groups and upcoming expert sessions are just one click away.

Let's explore the study groups. Sarah is part of the Data Structures Masters group. Here she collaborates with Maya on algorithm problems. They share messages, files, and schedule study sessions together. Real teamwork, real results.

But what happens when Sarah gets stuck? She asks the experts. She posted a question about optimizing recursive functions. Dr. Cohen, a verified computer science professor, responded with a detailed solution including working code. Problem solved in hours, not days.

For deeper learning, students can book live sessions with experts. One-on-one consultations or group workshops. Sarah has an Algorithm Problem Solving session scheduled with Dr. Cohen for next week.

Now let's see the expert view. Dr. Cohen logs in to his expert dashboard. He has a 4.8-star rating and has helped over 45 students. His profile shows his qualifications, specializations, and student reviews. Trust built through transparency.

Finally, platform administrators ensure quality. The admin dashboard provides user management, role assignments, and system oversight. A safe learning environment for everyone.

Coming soon: AI-powered study partner matching, smart scheduling, and personalized recommendations.

StudyBuddy. Where students find their tribe and experts share their knowledge. Built with React and Spring Boot. Let's revolutionize education together.
